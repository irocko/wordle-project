#note to self:

#scoring is a bit tricky with words with doubles letters.e.g target word = river, but rivet makes all green boxes
#work on this next. 
#possible ideas: 
#while iterating through the letters of guessword, place relevant clue, then add letter to list, and implement a check that if it comes across again, place green/yellow clue
#completely redo the loop but instead of for loop use: for range(len()) and guess[i] = target[i]
